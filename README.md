Qonto Skill Test
==============================

--------

## 1. Overview

Using synthetic dataset generated by the PaySim mobile money simulator, build a machine learning model to detect fraudulent movements and prevent account takeover fraud (ATO), also known as account compromise.

## 2. Motivation

Detect fraudulent movements is one of the main issue of any banking company, as Qonto is growing pretty fast building a detection tool is necessary. 

## 3. Success metrics

There is many ways of using the output of this product and we could / have to build an appropriate success metric for each of them.
We can assume that it's a real time topic and that we may not want to put some transactions on hold to be manually reviewed before being accepted.
The obvious business goal is to reduce the number of transactions that will be cashed out by blocking them and so save money.

## 4. Requirements & Constraints

We could split the constraints in 2 parts, the ones from the model himself (training time, performances...) and the ones from the pipeline (latency, data need in the API call...). Most of the requirements have to be discussed and validated with the business (and / or tech) stackeholders.  
In this product we are talking about fraud detection and the end goal is to score any incoming transaction.  

__Model Requirements :__
* Training Time : We won't retrain the model with each new transaction but use a pre trained model to do the predictions so this is not really a constraint here. Even a complex machine learning model won't be that long to train and we can do it whenever we need.
* Performances : The end goal is to block (without any humain check) the high risk predicted transactions so we have to ensure a very high performance. In this use case we can't have too many false positive because the customer experience will suffer a lot. The KPI to monitore here is the precision, we may need to do a rought tradeoff to ensure excellent precision even if the recall suffers in return.
* Latency : As explained no issue on the training part in term of computing time, but this is not the same deal on the scoring side. The model has to be simple enought to ensure a really quick responding time (between 20 and 100ms).  

__Pipeline Requirements :__
* Data : To be able to score the transaction we will need some information about it. In the end the model has to be called with some meta data about the transaction (transaction type, amount...).
* Latency : As it's a real time plugged product every call has to be fast, the target is to have a pipeline running in less than 100ms.  

## 5. Methodology

### 5.1. Problem statement

This is a fraud detection problem so it could be advised using either supervised or unsupervised way. In this case we will train a supervised model to score the transactions. 

### 5.2. Data

What data will you use to train your model? What input data is needed during serving?

### 5.3. Techniques

What machine learning techniques will you use? How will you clean and prepare the data (e.g., excluding outliers) and create features?

### 5.4. Experimentation & Validation

How will you validate your approach offline? What offline evaluation metrics will you use?

If you're A/B testing, how will you assign treatment and control (e.g., customer vs. session-based) and what metrics will you measure? What are the success and [guardrail](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/designing-experimentation-guardrails-ed6a976ec669) metrics?

### 5.5. Human-in-the-loop

How will you incorporate human intervention into your ML system (e.g., product/customer exclusion lists)?

## 7. Appendix

### 7.1. Alternatives

What alternatives did you consider and exclude? List pros and cons of each alternative and the rationale for your decision.

### 7.2. Experiment Results

Share any results of offline experiments that you conducted.

### 7.3. Performance benchmarks

Share any performance benchmarks you ran (e.g., throughput vs. latency vs. instance size/count).

### 7.4. Milestones & Timeline

What are the key milestones for this system and the estimated timeline?

### 7.5. Glossary

Define and link to business or technical terms.

### 7.6. References

Add references that you might have consulted for your methodology.
